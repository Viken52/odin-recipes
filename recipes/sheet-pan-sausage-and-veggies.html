    <p>Sheet Pan Sausage and Veggies makes for the best simple, filling, and nutritious dinner with virtually no cleanup! <br>
       A killer seasoning blend gets tossed with your favorite veggies and smoked sausage and roasted to perfection.</p>
    
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups diced baby red potatoes</li>
        <li>3 cups trimmed and halved green beans</li>
        <li>1 large head of broccoli</li>
        <li>1 1/2 cups chopped bell peppers</li>
        <li>13 ounces smoked sausage</li>
        <li>6 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon red pepper flakes</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon paprika</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon <em>EACH:</em> dried oregano, dried parsley </li>
        <li>Salt & pepper</li>
        <li><em>Serve with:</em> fresh parsley, quinoa/rice, lots of freshly grated parmesan cheese</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><em>PREP:</em> Preheat the over to 400 degrees F. Line a very large sheet pan <br>
        or 2 smaller pans with parchment paper and set aside.
        </li>
        <li><em>PREP VEGGIES:</em> It is important to prep the veggies to ensure they all cook <br>
        at the same rate. Wash and chop the unpeeled baby potatoes. You want the pieced <br>
        quite small. I halve the baby potatoes and then dice each half. This yields a total of 10-12 <br>
        pieces per potato. Trim the green beans and then cut in half, chop the broccoli into florets, <br>
        chop the peppers into 1-inch pieces, and the sausage in thick (1/2-inch) slices.</li>
        <li><em>OLIVE OIL AND SEASONINGS:</em> Place all the veggies and sausages on the prepared sheet pan. <br>
        Pour the olive oil and all the seasonings on top. Season to taste with salt and pepper (I add <br>
        1/2 teaspoon of salt and 1/4 teaspoon pepper to start with). Use your hands to toss and evenly <br>
        coat all the veggies and sausage with seasonings. Space everythojng out so it has plenty of <br>
        space to cook. If veggies are crammed/overlapping they'll steam instead of roast  and will <br>
        take longer to cook.
    </li>
    <li><em>BAKE:</em> Bake 15 minutes, remove from the oven and flip/stir all the veggies aroung. Return to <br>
    the oven and bake for another 10-15 minutes or until veggies are crisp-tender.
    </li>
    </ol>
