This was my very first assignment with The Odin Project curriculem. I learned how to fill out the HTML boilerplate, create directory and files, navigate through the terminal, use headers, paragraphs, images, and links. I was able to create ordered and unordered lists for my recipes. Most importantly, I was able to organize "beginner friendly" clean code so it is readable and understandable to any viewer.
